## Purpose and Goal of this Project/Repository

As markets become increaseingly more volatile, and trading becomes more automated thanks to algorythmic trading, it has become more significant to take in a larger volume of information to make better informed decisions regarding investments in markets around the globe - more information than can be reasonably expected of a person to parse through and analyze individually. The goal of this project is to create a model that will analyze data fed into it by creating a model based off of historical data and using it to predict returns on future data based on trends. 

This predictive random forrest model will focus on NASDAQ companies, and will use data from every single ticker in the exchange over the course of a year from July 2019 to  July 2020 to train amd test the data - over 900,000 data points. Our goal with this is to practice more in the creation of models for forecasting purposes, as well as to familiarize ourselves more with AWS infrastructure, given that we will be using Sagemaker to collaborate on the project.
